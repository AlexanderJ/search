# search
Example how to create a multiplatform search dialog and context menu for word explanation.

This project does not really fulfill a functional purpose. It is merely intended to experiment with iOS15/macOS12 SwiftUI search features.

Another test uses the context menu to display the explanation for a word. This use-case only makes sense for iOS and is actually misusing the functionality.
